        <p>
          I grew up in Western Springs Illinois, which is about fifteen minutes outside of Chicago.
          My family and friends have always been the most important part of my life and have exposed
          me to many hobbies and interests. My grandmothers on both sides of my family were artists,
          so growing up I spent a lot of time tapping into my creativity with drawing and painting. My
          parents helped me develop love for travel as a kid, and since then I have visited many amazing
          countries both with my family and student travel groups.

              <h3>Friends and Family</h3>
              <p>
                The people I surround myself with have been so integral in my personal development.
                I attribute most of my values to my amazing parents, who have been together for 40 years.
                My sister Lea is older than me by 4 years and is my closest confidant. I've maintained
                really close relationships with some of my childhood friends, and have
                met some amazing friends in college. I currently live with my 5 best friends who I met through
                my sorority.

              <h3>Me in Chicago</h3>
              <p>Though I grew up outside of Chicago, I had the opportunity to live downtown this past summer,
                which really deepened my love for the city.</p>

              <p>My immediate family consists of my mom Anna, my dad Steve, my
                sister Lea, and of course, our perfect dog Cody. Lea and I actually
                have our mother's last name, Voytovich. My dad's last name, Rudolph, 
                is both of our middle names.

              <h3>The "Dynamic Duo"</h3>
              <p>My sister and I have always been very close, but spending so much
                time together during the COVID-19 lockdown solidified us as best friends.
                She is a big reason why I chose U of M, as she was a senior when I was a freshman there.

              <h3>Delta Gamma</h3>
              <p>I've met so many amazing girls through my sorority. Kennedi (far left), Olivia (left)
                and Abby (right) are some of my current roommates who I will also be living with senior year.
                I love them so much.

              <h3>Travel</h3>
              <p>
                Seeing the world and understanding different cultures is super important to me. I have studied
                the Spanish language my whole life, so I've made an effort to travel to countries where the primary
                spoken language is Spanish!

              <h3>Momi, Western Fiji</h3>
              <p>Fiji is the most beautiful country I've been to. Most people think of it as just a 
                beachy island, but it is actually a very mountainous country!

              <h3>Parismina, Costa Rica</h3>
              <p>I actually camped during my stay in Costa Rica. It is definitely a country
                where you can really immerse yourself in nature. Panthers, monkeys and 
                sloths were some of the notable wildlife I encountered there.

              <h3>Florence, Italy</h3>
              <p>Italy is the only country in Europe I've had the pleasure of visiting.
                I went on a school trip, and we stayed in Rome, Florence and Venice. 
                Florence was my favorite of the three cities, as it is home to some amazing artwork.

              <h3>Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic</h3>
              <p>Santo Domingo was the first colonial settlement in the Americas. Though it features
                a heavy European influence, especially in architecture, it is a hub for Dominican culture.
                Pictured above is the Cathedral of Santa Mar√≠a la Menor, the first and oldest in the Americas.

              <h3>Graphic Design</h3>
              <p>
                Graphic design isn't my favorite art medium, but I made a lot of posters on Adobe Illustrator
                for my friends to hang up in their rooms at college. I prefer to draw on physical paper,
                but I hand-drew these posters with a mouse and my laptop.

              <h3>Bethesda</h3>
              <p>One of my best friends is from Bethesda, so I made her a pop-art inspired
                poster for one of her hometown spots.
              </p>

              <h3>Delta Gamma</h3>
              The cream colored rose is a symbol of Delta Gamma, so I made a poster
              to hang up in our sorority house.

              <h3>Iowa Phi Delt</h3>
              <p>My good friend is a Phi Delt at the University of Iowa, so I drew
                his fraternity house for him.</p>
